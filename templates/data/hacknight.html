If you have an existing app, integrate payments in your app, work on API access, and/or improve the UI of your app.</p><strong>What will you get from this hacknight?</strong><p>1. Access to APIs from banks which you can integrate with your app. We'll announce details shortly.<br>2. Learn from designers on how to improve the UI of your app, what concrete steps can be taken, towards what goals.<br>3. Mentorship from people from the industry who can guide you in integrating APIs in your app, and give you feedback on your projects.</p><strong>Format:</strong><p>The hacknight will start at 7 PM on Friday, 13 Jan, with a talk on UI design (details will be announced later this week).</p><p>Participants attending the hacknight should assemble at Razorpay by 8 PM.
