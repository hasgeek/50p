          The payments space in India is evolving rapidly and it is important to know the state of the industry. The focus on digital payments is clear now. The government is actively pushing digital means of disbursal of benefits with Direct Benefit Transfer, the National Bill Payment Service and more. Tolls are set to become faster and have lesser waiting times with the use of digital payment systems. Peer to peer payment systems are getting quite the traction. The ecommerce industry is benefiting from the shift to electronic payment means and is seeing a rise in online purchases. Multiple forms are promising to revolutionize payments for everyone. The industry is also moving towards other forms of payments such as microlending, brokerage, and crowdsourcing. The focus on digital footprints and privacy is more important than before. With the data flowing through multiple nodes before it reaches the payment systems, there is a risk of the data being compromised. Payment systems are also regarded as critical infrastructure and can cause much bigger effects with even a small breach. We are currently looking for talks and workshops involving payment services, banks, financial institutions, early stage startups, government agencies and If you’re someone who is working in the payments industry and have deployed solutions for your app or service, we are accepting submissions for the first edition on 8 July, 2017 in Mumbai.

We sent 11 members of our team including interns, and I\'d do it all over again without thinking twice! This is the standard of discourse we should try and maintain across any conference or event we organize, these guys at HasGeek have a thing or two to teach the rest of our tech ecosystem.</p>',
